   abstract = {Current emission pledges to the Paris Agreement appear insufficient to hold the global average 11 temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels 1. Yet, details are missing on how to 12 track progress towards the 'Paris goal', inform the five-yearly 'global stocktake', and increase the 13 ambition of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). We develop a nested structure of key 14 indicators to track progress through time. Global emissions 2,3 track aggregated progress 1 , country-15 level decomposition track emerging trends 4-6 that link directly to NDCs 7 , and technology diffusion 8-10 16 indicates future reductions. We find the recent slowdown in global emissions growth 11 is due to 17 reduced growth in coal use since 2011, primarily in China and secondarily the United States 12. The 18 slowdown is projected to continue in 2016, with global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry 19 similar to the 2015 level of 36GtCO2. Explosive and policy-driven growth in wind and solar has 20 contributed to the global emissions slowdown, but has been less important than economic factors and 21 energy efficiency. We show that many key indicators are currently broadly consistent with emission 22 scenarios that keep temperatures below 2°C, but the continued lack of large-scale Carbon Capture and 23 Storage 13 threatens 2030 targets and the longer-term Paris ambition of net-zero emissions. 24},

   abstract = {CO 2 emissions are of global concern because of climate change. China has become the largest CO 2 emitter in the world and presently accounts for 30% of global emissions. Here, we analyze the major drivers of energy-related CO 2 emissions in China from 1978 when the reform and opening-up policy was launched. We find that 1) there has been a 6-fold increase in energy-related CO 2 emissions, which was driven primarily (176%) by economic growth followed by population growth (16%), while the effects of energy intensity (−79%) and carbon intensity (−13%) slowed the growth of carbon emissions over most of this period; 2) energy-related CO 2 emissions are positively related to per capita gross domestic product (GDP), population growth rate, carbon intensity, and energy intensity; and 3) a portfolio of command-and-control policies affecting the drivers has altered the total emission trend. However, given the major role of China in global climate change mitigation, significant future reductions in China's CO 2 emissions will require transformation toward low-carbon energy systems.},

   abstract = {Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be traced to five economic sectors: energy, industry, buildings, transport and AFOLU (agriculture, forestry and other land uses). In this topical review, we synthesise the literature to explain recent trends in global and regional emissions in each of these sectors. To contextualise our review, we present estimates of GHG emissions trends by sector from 1990 to 2018, describing the major sources of emissions growth, stability and decline across ten global regions. Overall, the literature and data emphasise that progress towards reducing GHG emissions has been limited. The prominent global pattern is a continuation of underlying drivers with few signs of emerging limits to demand, nor of a deep shift towards the delivery of low and zero carbon services across sectors. We observe a moderate decarbonisation of energy systems in Europe and North America, driven by fuel switching and the increasing penetration of renewables. By contrast, in rapidly industrialising regions, fossil-based energy systems have continuously expanded, only very recently slowing down in their growth. Strong demand for materials, floor area, energy services and travel have driven emissions growth in the industry, buildings and transport sectors, particularly in Eastern Asia, Southern Asia and South-East Asia. An expansion of agriculture into carbon-dense tropical forest areas has driven recent increases in AFOLU emissions in Latin America, South-East Asia and Africa. Identifying, understanding, and tackling the most persistent and climate-damaging trends across sectors is a fundamental concern for research and policy as humanity treads deeper into the Anthropocene.},
